Once you completed your web-site, blog or user guide it is time to publish it online, so everyone can access it.

One of the major benefits of static web-sites is a hosting option. As it is not required to maintain backend server and database there are many cheap or free options available for hosting the static content. Below are same most popular and easy to setup services.

## Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) enable hosting web-site for free with custom domain, netlify domain (with an ability to select the sub-domain name), wildcard certificate etc. There is an option to upload site directly or link it to git repository (for example hosted on GitHub).
